# Billboard to Spotify Playlist

Author: Naiha

## Overview

This Python script allows you to create a Spotify playlist of Billboard Hot 100 songs from a specific year. It scrapes the Billboard website for the top songs of a given date, finds their corresponding tracks on Spotify, and creates a private Spotify playlist with those songs.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Requests (for making HTTP requests)
- python-dotenv (for loading environment variables)
- Spotipy (for interacting with the Spotify API)

## Setup

1. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests python-dotenv spotipy
